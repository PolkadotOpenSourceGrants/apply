# DotBot

## Project Overview
This desktop application represents a natural language interface for Polkadot blockchain operations, enabling users to execute complex transactions through conversational AI rather than traditional technical interfaces.

### Core Functionality

The platform leverages large language model technology to bridge the gap between user intent and blockchain execution. Users can describe their desired blockchain operations in plain English, eliminating the need for technical knowledge of transaction construction, extrinsic formatting, or specific runtime calls.

### Technical Architecture

The system interprets natural language requests and automatically generates the corresponding Polkadot transactions, including proper parameter encoding, fee calculations, and runtime-specific formatting. The AI handles the complexity of translating user intentions into valid extrinsics that can be submitted to the Polkadot network or its parachains. The core LLM is using [Fetch.AI](http://fetch.ai/) agents through Agentverse to prepare these transactions handling multi-step operations and monitoring transaction status without requiring further user input.

### User Experience

Rather than navigating complex blockchain interfaces or writing code, users simply communicate their objectives conversationally. For example, a user might say "I want to stake 100 DOT to validator XYZ" or "Transfer 50 tokens to this address with a memo," and the system generates the precise transaction required.

### User Journey

The following user journey - which asks for swapping some token to another one - demonstrates one of the capability of DotBot:

1. The user starts by describing the request in the chat: *“Please DotBot, swap my USDC to DOT.”*
2. DotBot asks for the desired amount to swap.
3. The user specifies the amount (e.g., *“Please swap 500 USDC.”*).
4. DotBot asks which USDC (on which chain) to swap, and the desired destination chain.
5. The user defines the chain (e.g., *“Please swap the USDC on AssetHub, and set the destination chain to AssetHub as well.”*).
6. DotBot creates the transaction and presents it in a human-readable way.
    
    Example: *“Based on your request, the initiated transaction is awaiting your approval. After signing, it will swap 500 USDC from AssetHub to 118.5 DOT on Hydration, then automatically send the DOT back to your AssetHub account. Estimated execution time: 30 seconds. Total transaction fee: $0.262.”*
    
7. DotBot sends the transaction to the wallet, prompting the wallet extension to pop up for signing.
8. The user signs the transaction in the wallet extension.
9. Once the transaction is successful, DotBot displays the result. (e.g.: *“Your transaction was successful! 500 USDC on AssetHub was swapped for 118.5 DOT, which is now in your AssetHub account. Would you like to do more with your DOT?”*
10. The user closes or continues requests with DotBot.

**Side Note:** As an atomic swapping engine, DotBot will use Hydration’s [Remote Swap](https://docs.hydration.net/devs/remote_swaps). Keep in mind that the swapping capability mentioned above is only one of DotBot’s possible features. DotBot will also be able to move tokens across parachains and perform a variety of on-chain actions on different networks - for example, staking DOT on the Relay Chain, liquid staking DOT on Bifrost, providing liquidity in the omnipool on Hydration or StellaSwap, or even sending DOT or parachain tokens out of the Polkadot ecosystem via Hyperbridge or Snowbridge to use on EVM chains.

### Security Model

The tool maintains a secure separation between transaction creation and execution. While the AI constructs the transaction based on user input, the user retains full control through the signing process, ensuring private keys remain secure and users can review all transaction details before authorization.

This approach democratizes access to Polkadot's sophisticated features by removing technical barriers while preserving the security and decentralization principles of blockchain technology.

Additionally, we are planning to implement a limit on transfer, and protection against slippage when doing swaps, most likely by time limit. 

## Market Research

Several blockchain ecosystems have developed natural language transaction interfaces, but each faces significant limitations that highlight the advantages of building such a tool specifically for Polkadot.

### Existing Solutions

**Griffin AI's Transaction Execution Agent (TEA)** represents the most advanced current solution, operating across multiple EVM-compatible networks including Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, and Polygon. Users can interact conversationally to send tokens, execute swaps on Uniswap, and manage wallet operations through natural language commands.

[Fetch.ai](http://fetch.ai/)'s uAgent EVM MCP** provides natural language access to over 30 EVM-compatible blockchains through the Model Context Protocol, while **Infura's MCP server** enables natural language queries for Ethereum on-chain data. Additionally, various platforms like SwarmZero offer NLP interfaces primarily focused on blockchain data analysis rather than transaction execution.

### Key Disadvantages

**Ecosystem Limitations** represent the most significant constraint. Current solutions are overwhelmingly EVM-centric, meaning they cannot access the sophisticated cross-chain capabilities, governance mechanisms, or parachain-specific features that define Polkadot's architecture. This creates artificial barriers between blockchain ecosystems and limits interoperability.

**Limited Cross-Chain Functionality** represents a critical gap in current offerings. While some tools operate across multiple EVM chains, they lack true cross-chain transaction capabilities that would allow seamless asset movement and complex operations spanning different blockchain architectures. This fragmentation forces users to maintain separate interfaces and workflows for different networks.

**Security and Complexity Trade-offs** present ongoing challenges. While these tools aim to simplify blockchain interactions, they often sacrifice transparency and user control for convenience. Users may struggle to understand the underlying transactions being generated, potentially exposing them to unintended risks or sub-optimal execution paths.

A Polkadot-native solution would address these fundamental disadvantages by leveraging the network's inherent interoperability, sophisticated governance infrastructure, and parachain specialization while avoiding the ecosystem fragmentation that currently limits natural language blockchain interfaces.

## Ecosystem Fit

This natural language transaction tool would function as **universal infrastructure** within the Polkadot ecosystem, serving as a universal interface layer that bridges the gap between user intent and complex blockchain operations. By integrating seamlessly with Polkadot's cross-consensus messaging protocol, it would enable users to execute sophisticated cross-parachain transactions through simple conversational commands, dramatically expanding accessibility to the network's advanced features.

The tool would significantly amplify governance participation by simplifying referendum voting and treasury proposals, while simultaneously making each parachain's unique runtime features accessible to non-technical users. Whether users want to engage with Hydration’s DeFi protocols, Moonbeam's EVM compatibility, or any other specialized parachain functionality, the conversational interface would translate their intentions into proper transactions automatically.

From a strategic perspective, this tool would accelerate ecosystem-wide adoption by serving as both a **universal API layer** for developers and an educational bridge for new users. Rather than building separate transaction construction logic, dApp developers could integrate a single conversational interface, while users naturally learn about staking, governance, and cross-chain operations through interaction rather than documentation.

The broader ecosystem impact would be substantial, likely increasing transaction volumes across parachains, enhancing cross-chain liquidity flows, and improving network security through simplified staking participation. Most importantly, this tool would position itself as **foundational infrastructure** that other ecosystem participants build upon, ultimately accelerating Polkadot's vision of a truly interoperable and user-accessible Web3 ecosystem rather than functioning as merely another application layer.

Most people who don’t have extensive experience in web3 might not be able to use the user interfaces in the Polkadot ecosystem, thus DotBot aiming to solve this current problem. DotBot’s target audience is people who are transitioning from web2 or people who are web3 beginners. On the long run, we are planning to add many more features to DotBot, meaning that the user will not have to use complex UIs at all, you can learn on this later at the section of Future Plans.

After careful research on existing AI agents in the Polkadot ecosystem, we found only a few initiatives: a [forum post](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/polkabot-ai-decentralized-ai-education-hub-on-polkadot/7030) about [PolkaBot.AI](http://polkabot.ai/) (an education-purpose AI bot) on the Polkadot Forum. We also found governance‐related AI efforts such as [Clarys.AI](http://clarys.ai/). It’s experimental and only focusing on OpenGov.

The most similar AI agent to our concept of DotBot appears to be Mimo, developed by [Mimir](https://mimir.global/).  However, Mimo’s capabilities are limited to the Mimir platform interface, it currently does not support XCM transfers and only shows basic information (such as account balances). Additionally, Mimo functions solely within Mimir’s multisig platform interface, whereas DotBot targets single-signatory account users, meaning our users won’t need to use a multisig-specific platform.

On the long run, we want to make DotBot into a library, meaning, that web3 wallets and other applications can integrate it. The steps that are currently taking in this direction, is that we are making the backend optional, meaning, that the frontend component is functional in itself, and the backend is adding extra features, like transaction history, or notifications for a registered profile (it reminds you of certain events, related to staking, for example). The frontend is making calls to agentverse, which is a decentralized AI marketplace.

# Future Plans

We are trying to develop the frontend in a way, that it can be bundled into a lib later, and we are also thinking about a widget, that can be embedded into other sites and application.

Also, we will add more-and-more capabilities to the tool (functions related to staking, cross-chain asset swaps and governance functions) as we continue developing the tool. 

We are planning to create a mobile version in the future as well.

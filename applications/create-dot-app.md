# Create Dot App

## Project Overview

### Project Summary
Create Dot App is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline the development process for Polkadot-based decentralized applications (dApps). Similar to popular scaffolding tools like `create-react-app` or `create-next-app`, this tool enables developers to quickly bootstrap new Polkadot projects with pre-configured templates and best practices.

### Problem Statement
Currently, developers entering the Polkadot ecosystem face significant barriers when starting new projects:
- **Complex Setup Process**: Setting up a new Polkadot dApp requires extensive configuration of dependencies, blockchain connections, and development environments
- **Scattered Resources**: Developers must manually research and integrate various tools, libraries, and patterns
- **Inconsistent Project Structure**: Lack of standardized project templates leads to inconsistent codebases and development practices
- **High Learning Curve**: New developers spend considerable time on boilerplate setup rather than focusing on core application logic
- **Limited Framework Options**: While `npx create-polkadot-dapp` exists as a scaffolding tool, it is currently heavily limited to React-based projects only, leaving developers who prefer other modern frontend frameworks (Vue.js, Svelte) without suitable starter options

### Solution Overview
Create Dot App addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive, framework-agnostic alternative to the existing `create-polkadot-dapp` tool. While the current solution serves React developers well, Create Dot App expands the ecosystem support to include multiple popular frontend frameworks, ensuring that developers can work with their preferred technology stack.

**ðŸš€ One-Command Setup**
```bash
npx create-dot-app
```

**ðŸŽ¯ Multiple Frontend Framework Support**
- React and Vue (1st phase)
- Next and Nuxt (2nd phase)

**Planned Templates**

- **Frontend Frameworks:** Svelte, SvelteKit, Solid, Remix
- **Backend Frameworks:**Â Hono, Elysia, Fastify, H3

Open to feedback for additional frameworks

**ðŸ“¦ Pre-configured Starter Templates**

SDK integrations:
- Basic wallet connection
- Read on-chain data (account balance)
- Subscribe to on-chain data (latest block number)
- Submit on-chain data (remark)
- Multi-chain connection (mainnet and testnet)

Framework integrations:
- Tailwind CSS (with additional icon and UI plugins)
- TypeScript
- ESLint plugin

**ðŸ”§ Multiple SDK Integration Choices**
For maximum flexibility and developer choice, each frontend framework template will offer two modern Polkadot API integration options:
- **PAPI (Polkadot API)** - The next-generation type-safe Polkadot API
- **Dedot** - A lightweight, modern TypeScript SDK for Polkadot

For example, React developers can choose between:
- `react-papi` - React template with PAPI integration
- `react-dedot` - React template with Dedot integration

This multiple-SDK approach ensures developers can work with their preferred API layer while maintaining the same frontend framework, offering templates like:
- `nextjs-papi`, `nextjs-dedot`
- `vue-papi`, `vue-dedot`, `nuxtjs-papi`, `nuxtjs-dedot`
- `svelte-papi`, `svelte-dedot`, `sveltekit-papi`, `sveltekit-dedot`

**ðŸ”§ Built-in Best Practices**
- Modern API integration with PAPI or Dedot SDKs (developer's choice)
- Wallet connection utilities (Polkadot.js extension, Talisman, SubWallet)
- TypeScript configurations optimized for Polkadot development

### Key Features
1. **Interactive Project Setup**: Guided CLI prompts for selecting frameworks, SDK preferences (PAPI vs Dedot), templates, and configurations
2. **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation between blockchain logic and frontend presentation with choice of modern API layers
3. **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, type safety, and comprehensive documentation for both PAPI and Dedot integrations
4. **Multi-chain Support**: Templates compatible with Polkadot, Kusama, and custom Substrate chains across both SDK options
5. **Production Ready**: Optimized build configurations and deployment guides for each framework-SDK combination

### Target Audience
- **Multi-Framework Developers**: Developers who prefer Vue.js, Svelte, or other modern frameworks beyond React
- **New Polkadot Developers**: Developers transitioning from other blockchain ecosystems who want to use their familiar frontend tools
- **Web2 Developers**: Frontend developers looking to build their first blockchain application with their preferred framework
- **Hackathon Participants**: Teams needing to quickly prototype Polkadot-based solutions using diverse technology stacks
- **Educational Institutions**: Universities and bootcamps teaching blockchain development across multiple frontend frameworks
- **Enterprise Teams**: Companies building internal tools or client solutions on Polkadot with specific technology requirements

### Expected Impact
- **Reduced Time-to-Market**: From hours of setup to minutes
- **Lower Barrier to Entry**: Simplified onboarding for new developers
- **Ecosystem Growth**: More applications and developers joining Polkadot
- **Code Quality Improvement**: Standardized patterns and best practices
- **Community Building**: Shared templates and collaborative development

## Additional Information

According to the [State of JavaScript 2024 survey](https://2024.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks/#front_end_frameworks_ratios), React's dominance is showing signs of decline with decreasing interest and satisfaction metrics among developers, while alternative frameworks like Vue.js and Svelte are gaining momentum and maintaining higher satisfaction rates. This trend validates the importance of providing developers with diverse framework options beyond React-only solutions, making Create Dot App's comprehensive multi-framework support particularly relevant for the evolving JavaScript ecosystem.

Additionally, this project has received extensive feedback and validation from the Polkadot UX Bounty team. The detailed feedback and discussions can be found at [Create-Dot-App UX Bounty Review](https://polkadot-ux-bounty.notion.site/Create-Dot-App-22ce1c2781f3802d87a4c97d898f42e6).

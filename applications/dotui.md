# DOT UI

## Project Overview

- A scaffolding UI kit for Polkadot
- Pre-built UI components for interacting with Polkadot and Kusama parachains.
- Leverage existing Polkadot.js, the many libraries and tools available in the ecosystem to build robust UI components for dapp developers to leverage and ship faster.
- I have a lot of experience in building UI components and have a deep understanding of the Polkadot ecosystem.

### Project Details

- Technology stack
  - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  - [Lucide icons](https://lucide.dev/)
  - [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
  - [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/)
  - [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/)
  - [Viem](https://viem.sh/)
  - [Polkadot API](https://github.com/polkadot-api/polkadot-api)
  - [Jotai](https://jotai.org/)
  - [Tanstack React Query](https://tanstack.com/query)
  - [Vaul](https://vaul.fun/)
  - [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
  - [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- [DotUI Github](https://github.com/buildstationorg/dotui)
- [DotUI Website](https://dotui.buildstation.org/)
- The project will implement components for common dapp use cases like connect wallet, swap, portfolio sidebar, transaction history, staking, cross chain transfer/bridge, AI interface, blink interface for X card, etc. Also aiming to support various parachains.
- The project will not be released as a package on NPM. Developers will get access to the full code of the components with full control to customize and extend the components to their needs.

### Ecosystem Fit

- The project aims to help polkadot dapp developers to get started with sensible default UI components, reducing the time to market for dapps.
- It aims to serve primarily dapp developers serving users rather than infrastructure developers.
- Provide a templates, examples, documentation as well as reference for AI generated code for Polkadot dapp developers. Plus a significant focus on pushing the boundaries of UI/UX in the Polkadot ecosystem.
- The closest in Polkadot ecosystem is [Reactive Dot](https://reactivedot.dev/) but Reactive Dot is more react hooks rather than pre-built UI components. Other similar projects are [Onchainkit](https://onchainkit.xyz/) from Base team but DotUI is more like [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com) (pre-built UI components that you can copy and paste into your project).

## Future Plans

Please include here

- Long term, the project will aim to monetize with the following:
  - Paid support and consulting for dapps
  - Donations from Polkadot parachains
  - Alternative frontend fee for users when they use DotUI
  - Custom Liquid Staking Token and use the yield to fund the project

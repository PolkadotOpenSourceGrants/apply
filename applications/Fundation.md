# Fundation  

## Project Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tagline (one sentence summary)
build fast and break things code that allows to go from 0 to 1 fast 
- A brief description of your project
Fundation is a set module that allow the dev to build dapps fast 
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Polkadot (SDK) / Kusama
the main goals is to be easy to build dapp on top of assethub and rullups allow fast dev time
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project
I was building my first dapp stake2build on polkadot a year and a half only to realize how far behind polkadot is on front end or web devoper side of tooling altho we made alot of improvement i still belive this tool will be of great benfits to the community 
### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- An overview of the technology stack to be used
the core stack 
nextjs 
tailwind shadcn 
indexeddb and sqllite 
polkadot-api
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
https://www.fundation.dev/ and mvp is https://www.fundation.dev/login
- Mockups/designs of any UI components
i have a bunch of video on my x page show update and ideas 
https://x.com/swenw31

- What your project is *not* or will *not* provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and clarify any limitations that might not be obvious
with this grant i will be manily fouced on the fundation module and system chains and will not include any thirdparty rollups 
### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
mainly on the front end side of the dev stack 
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
small time dev and hackathons and those looking to kickstart there porject fast 
- What need(s) does your project meet?
grow the devoper pool by bring dowwn the barreyer to entry 
- How did you identify these needs? Please provide evidence in the form of (scientific) articles, forum discussions, case studies, or raw data.
this has been talked about around the commummity for a while and there are many trying to sovle the time to market for polkadot dev i think this solction will be one of them 
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem? Make sure to at least check the [Polkadot Forum](https://forum.polkadot.network/), the [wiki's Tech Stack doc](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-open-source) and [OpenGov](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda?status=executed&is_treasury=true).
- Apillon: A Polkadot-focused Web3 platform offering UI and API integration for parachain services.

- Thirdweb: An Ethereum/EVM-focused platform with SDKs and smart contract tools, targeting games and creator platforms.

- Magic: An Ethereum-based authentication tool using passwordless logins, not a full DApp solution.
  - If so, how is your project different? Please identify and assess any projects addressing the same need and explain how your project is distinct. Feel free to include applicable research data, statistics, or metrics.
  - If not, please indicate why such a project might not have been possible, successful, or attempted. 
- Are there any projects similar to yours in related ecosystems? 

 Differentiation:
- Fundation is open-source and self-hostable, prioritizing ease of use and flexibility. Unlike Apillon or Thirdweb, it doesn’t rely on third-party services—ensuring developers retain control and can adapt it freely without waiting for external updates.

Please describe the team's relevant experience, such as Polkadot-related projects in progress or contributions to the ecosystem made by team members in the past.
ive been around polkadot for sometime but just reacenty decided to get more active enged in a bigger way fundation was going to be inter tool i would use when build my own dapps but i see a great need so i am here looking for funding other projects i also just started a new intive BuildOnDot community on X this has nothing todo with the grant that has a much simpler goal of getting new dev more conferable and conntect to the polkadot ecosystem

## Development Status

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.
will be adding this later as i am working on some muck-ups for mini-dapps that will be built along side to showcase the functions 

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected. Below, we provide an **example milestone** with mandatory (0a to 0e) and example deliverables.

# Fundation  

## Project Overview
Tagline:
Build fast and break things: a toolkit for going from concept to launch quickly.

Project Description:
Fundation is a set of modules that empowers developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) rapidly on the Polkadot ecosystem.

Integration with Polkadot/Kusama:
The primary goal of Fundation is to simplify dApp development on top of Asset Hub and rollups, significantly reducing development time.

Team's Motivation:
While building my first dApp on Polkadot, Stake2Build, over a year and a half ago, I realized how far behind the ecosystem was in front-end and web developer tooling. Although many improvements have been made since then, I believe this tool will still be of great benefit to the community by addressing these ongoing challenges.

### Project Details
Technology Stack:
Core Stack: Next.js
UI: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
Database: IndexedDB and SQLite
API: Polkadot.js API

Proof of Concept (PoC)/MVP:
Website: https://www.fundation.dev/
MVP: https://www.fundation.dev/login

Mockups/UI Designs:
I have posted numerous videos on my X (formerly Twitter) page showcasing updates and ideas. You can view them here: https://x.com/swenw31.

### Ecosystem Fit
Fundation is positioned on the front-end side of the development stack.

### Target Audience:
Our target audience includes small-scale developers, participants in hackathons, and teams looking to kickstart their projects quickly.

### Needs Met:
The project aims to lower the barrier to entry for new developers, thereby expanding the Polkadot developer pool.

### Needs Identification:
The need for better developer tooling and a faster time-to-market has been a recurring topic within the Polkadot community for some time. Multiple projects are attempting to solve this, and I believe Fundation will be a valuable addition to these efforts.
### Comparison with Similar Projects:
- Apillon: A Polkadot-focused Web3 platform offering UI and API integration for parachain services.

- Thirdweb: An Ethereum/EVM-focused platform with SDKs and smart contract tools, targeting games and creator platforms.

- Magic: An Ethereum-based authentication tool using passwordless logins, not a full DApp solution.
  - If so, how is your project different? Please identify and assess any projects addressing the same need and explain how your project is distinct. Feel free to include applicable research data, statistics, or metrics.
  - If not, please indicate why such a project might not have been possible, successful, or attempted. 
- Are there any projects similar to yours in related ecosystems? 

Differentiation:
Fundation is open-source and self-hostable, prioritizing ease of use and flexibility. Unlike Apillon or Thirdweb, it doesnâ€™t rely on third-party services. This ensures developers retain full control over their work and can adapt it freely without waiting for external updates.

### Team's Experience
I have been involved in the Polkadot ecosystem for some time, but only recently decided to engage more actively. Fundation was initially intended as an internal tool for my own dApp development. However, seeing a greater need within the community, I am now seeking funding to develop it for a broader audience.

In addition to this project, I recently started a new initiative called the BuildOnDot community on X. While separate from this grant, its goal is to help new developers feel more comfortable and connected within the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Development Status

I have been documenting my progress, including concepts and mock-ups, through regular updates on X.
Personal Updates: https://x.com/swenw31
BuildOnDot Community: https://x.com/i/communities/1934658730303373790
I will be adding more formal mock-ups for the mini-dApps soon, which will be built to showcase the functionalities of Fundation.

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected. Below, we provide an **example milestone** with mandatory (0a to 0e) and example deliverables. 

**Please notice that Polkadot Open Source Grants only accept projects up to 3 months of duration and up to 2 milestones.**

### Overview

- **Estimated Duration:** 3 months
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  FTE of 1.0
- **Total Costs:** $28,000 USD

> Note that deliverables 0a to 0e are mandatory. Please adapt their specification to your project.

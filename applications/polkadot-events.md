# Polkadot Events Transparency & Resource Platform

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Polkadot Events Transparency & Resource Platform  
**Requested Amount:** $30,000 USD (payable in DOT)  
**Duration:** 6 months  
**License:** Apache 2.0  

## Abstract

An open-source comprehensive transparency and resource platform for the Polkadot events ecosystem, featuring real-time funding analytics, organizer resources, and community engagement tools. This platform addresses documented community needs for transparency and improved event management infrastructure, serving as the "Luma for Polkadot events" while maintaining full decentralization and open-source principles.

## Problem Statement & Community Demand

### Documented Community Pain Points

The Polkadot events ecosystem faces significant transparency and resource management challenges, as evidenced by:

**1. Events Bounty Transparency Issues (2025)**
Recent Events Bounty data shows 286 total submissions with only 146 approved, indicating a need for better transparency in funding decisions and application processes. The current system processed $950,000 in negotiated savings and returned 85,572 DOT (~$336,000) to the bounty, demonstrating the scale of funding that requires transparent tracking.

**2. Decentralized Events Infrastructure Gap (2023)**
The transition from centralized Web3 Foundation event management highlighted the critical need for decentralized event infrastructure, with no dedicated team managing events post-January 2024. The previous system managed comprehensive event infrastructure including registration systems, streaming capabilities, archival processes, networking platforms, and mobile applications.

**3. Resource Fragmentation Challenge**
Community feedback emphasized the importance of curated attendee and speaker engagement, requiring active community involvement for feedback on event locations, dates, and content curation. The Events Bounty team acknowledged the need for "creating and maintaining a resource centre" with documentation and tips for organizing events.

### Current Solution Limitations

While dotevents.xyz exists, it serves primarily as a niche calendar tool without addressing:
- Funding transparency and tracking
- Comprehensive organizer resource management  
- Real-time community engagement
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integrated notification systems

### Swush: A Unified DEX Aggregator for Polkadot's Cross-Chain Ecosystem

Swush is a cross-chain DEX aggregator for Polkadot. It finds and executes the best asset swap routes across parachains, abstracting away the complexity of XCM and multiple parachains and DEXs.

**Simple example:**

> **Want to swap DOT(Asset Hub) ‚Üí USDC(Bifrost)?**
> 
> Instead of manually checking rates across Asset Hub, Hydration, and Bifrost DEXs, Swush automatically finds the best route (e.g., Hydration offers 3% better rates), handles all XCM complexity, and executes in few clicks.


We delivered Swush v1, backed by a [Web3 Foundation grant](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/swush-dex-aggregator.md), an MVP that finds and executes optimal swaps across Asset Hub, Hydration. This validated the core model: users don't want to figure out XCM hops or check multiple DEXs - they just want the best swap, in one click.

> **You can try the early version here** ‚Üí [app.swush.me](https://app.swush.me/)
> 
> *(Use the Alice account via Chopsticks to simulate mainnet)*

With **Swush v2**, we are expanding this foundation into a full routing engine:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| üîÑ **Cross-chain swaps** | Best asset swap routes across Asset Hub, Hydration, Moonbeam, Acala, Bifrost |
| üåâ **Cross-ecosystem bridging** | Route and swap assets via Chainflip to Arbitrum and Solana |
| ‚ö° **Direct perps market access** | One-click deposits into Hyperliquid after swaps |
| üéØ **Reward-driven liquidity** | Incentives like vouchers, NFTs, or staking prompts on destination chains |

---


### Why Swush Matters for Polkadot

Polkadot‚Äôs core strength is interoperability. Yet today, the user experience for swaps and asset movement across parachains remains fragmented and difficult.

**Swush fills that gap, positioning itself as the liquidity access layer for Polkadot**. Much like **Jupiter on Solana** (routing 80% of Solana's DEX volume with $2.4B TVL) and **1inch on Ethereum** (60% market share across 9+ EVM chains), Swush is designed to:

- Aggregate liquidity across parachains and DEXs.
- Abstract away XCM and cross-chain complexity.
- Provide a sticky, incentive-driven experience that benefits both users and parachains.

While Jupiter dominates Solana and 1inch leads on EVM chains, **Polkadot lacks a unified liquidity aggregation layer** - which Swush addresses with XCM-native routing and cross-ecosystem bridging.


### User Incentives and Ecosystem-Alignment

Inspired by CRED (App to pay credit card bills), which rewards users for payments (e.g., pay bills), Swush brings a similar mechanic to DeFi.

Each successful swap earns users **Swush points** while also unlocking **post-swap action prompts** like staking, vaults, or dApp interactions on the target parachain. This reward system helps parachains **onboard and retain liquidity**, while users gain both loyalty benefits and deeper engagement opportunities.

     
| UI Card | Example |
|-------|------|
| <img width="250" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cd8c68f-4777-4169-98db-875c4a7aabf8" > | **Example Flow - Parachain Growth Incentives**<br/>1. User swaps DOT ‚Üí aUSD(Acala) on Swush<br/>2. Prompted to deposit aUSD into Acala's pool<br/>3. On successful deposit, unlocks reward (fee rebate, XP, or NFT tier) |



### Building Brand & Community Through NFTs

Taking inspiration from Pudgy Penguins - an NFT project that evolved into a full-fledged consumer brand - Swush plans to build an identity around its own original character: a playful, fiery avatar. 

<div align="center">
<img width="150" alt="swush-character" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0584067e-5069-4c92-a376-4ef63b4e078c" />
</div>


These NFTs are more than collectibles‚Äîthey‚Äôre brand anchors and functional rewards. Early supporters and active users will receive limited-edition **Swush Flame Avatars**, which can:

- Unlock premium features
- Be used in loyalty tiers or in future community campaigns
- Represent the user‚Äôs status or journey within the Swush ecosystem

**Over time, these avatars may evolve into a standalone IP - usable in content, merchandise, or cross-chain partnerships.** Just as Pudgy Penguins became more than NFTs through storytelling and emotional resonance, Swush aims to create a recognizable, narrative-driven brand that can grow alongside the product.

> Note: User incentives and NFTs are part of Swush‚Äôs long-term roadmap. They are not included in the current milestones of this proposal but illustrate our vision for creating a high-retention user ecosystem around Polkadot liquidity.


### Existing products

While tools like [Turtle.cool](https://turtle.cool/) provide basic cross-chain transfers and swaps, Swush differentiates itself as:

- A **comprehensive multi-hop swap router** that compares asset swap routes across various DEXs (Asset Hub, Hydration, Bifrost) rather than just a bridge
- **Deeply integrated** with multiple parachain DEXs and liquidity pools via XCM (Hydration, Moonbeam, Bifrost, Acala)
- **Cross-ecosystem enabled** with bridging capabilities via Chainflip to Arbitrum and Solana
- **Perps market gateway** providing direct access to Hyperliquid derivatives trading
- **Engagement engine** combining ecosystem incentives, and brand loyalty mechanics through reward-driven actions and NFT-based community building

This creates a strong foundation and a sticky, high-retention user experience.


### In Summary

Swush is simple:

- **Find the best path. Route the liquidity. Reward the user.**

It's not just a DEX aggregator, it's a **liquidity distribution engine** for parachains, a **loyalty engine** for users, **incentive alignment** for parachains, and **NFT consumer brand** on Polkadot.

### Cross-Parachain DEX Aggregation: Detailed Example

**Scenario:** User wants to swap DOT (Asset Hub) ‚Üí USDC (Bifrost)

**With Swush:**

- **Route 1**: DOT (Asset Hub) ‚Üí XCM to Bifrost ‚Üí Bifrost DEX (Rate: 3.98)
- **Route 2**: DOT (Asset Hub) ‚Üí XCM to Hydration ‚Üí Hydration DEX ‚Üí XCM to Bifrost (Rate: 4.02)
- **Route 3**: Asset Hub DEX ‚Üí XCM to Bifrost (Rate: 3.99)

**Result:** Swush automatically selects Route 2 (Hydration), giving user best swap rate.

**Hyperliquid** is a decentralized exchange for perpetual futures (‚Äúperps‚Äù) - a popular crypto trading product that lets users long or short assets with leverage, without expiry. Designed for speed and scale, it delivers sub-100ms trade execution, supports across 50+ markets, and secures over $750M in TVL.

- One-click flow: DOT/USDC/USDT ‚Üí Arbitrum (via Chainflip) ‚Üí Hyperliquid deposit.
- Revenue sharing through Hyperliquid's referral program, with referral links integrated directly into the Swush swap UI.

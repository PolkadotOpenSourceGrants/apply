- What your project is not or will not provide or implement. This is a place for you to manage expectations and clarify any limitations that might not be obvious.<br></br>
For this grant program, the plan is to develop an MVP of the project, and therefore Dazhbog will focus on delivering core functionalities while excluding non-essential components at this stage. Instead of implementing its own Oracle module, Dazhbog will rely on external spot price data from a trusted service. Backend services for event monitoring will not be included in the MVP, as they are not critical for the basic operation of the platform. 

### Ecosystem Fit

- Dazhbog fits into the Polkadot ecosystem as a decentralized financial platform specifically designed for trading perpetual futures contracts. Creating the MVP as an open-source project opens up opportunities for further development of the DeFi landscape within Polkadot. Dazhbog aims to contribute to the broader ecosystem by providing a foundational toolset that can be expanded and integrated with other Polkadot parachains and projects, enabling more innovative DeFi solutions.
- Our target audience includes all individuals who use DeFi, as they will find new opportunities trading on Dazhbog. This encompasses our team, who are deeply invested in using and improving the platform to meet the highest standards. Additionally, newcomers to DeFi who are eager to explore advanced financial instruments in a user-friendly and secure environment, Dazhbog aims to attract a diverse range of users, from experienced DeFi enthusiasts to those just beginning their journey in decentralized finance.
- Dazhbog addresses the growing demand for advanced financial instruments within the DeFi community. 
- In related ecosystems like Ethereum, projects such as dYdX and GMX Protocol offer decentralized perpetual futures trading. However, on Polkadot, there are no competitors that provide the advanced functionalities of Dazhbog.
- Our long-term vision for Dazhbog is to become a leading platform for decentralized perpetual futures trading within the Polkadot ecosystem. Ultimately, our goal is to contribute significantly to the DeFi space, providing a reliable and advanced trading platform that meets the evolving needs of the global financial community.

### Team's experience

- **Veles - funded by Polkadot OpenGov** (https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/496) - Veles pallet for enhancing the carbon credit market within the Polkadot ecosystem. A reliable, transparent solution for carbon credit management, leveraging blockchain to ensure accuracy and security in carbon credit issuance and trading.
- Demeter Farming Platform - The Demeter Farming platform is the first of its kind. The unique feature of this platform is the user's ability to farm with the same liquidity in multiple pools. The Platform also provides Farming-as-a-Service, which means that every project can create its farming/staking pools without coding.
- DEO Arena - The DEO Arena is a Play-to-Earn game. In-game currency is the token Demeter (DEO). Players spawn in the arena and the goal is to eliminate opponents using different weapons. Each player enters the match with a certain amount of DEO tokens, which are taken by the winner at the end.
- Hermes Governance System - The Governance platform is a tool for implementing the concept of decentralization in the Hermes DAO. Any user holding Hermes (HMX) tokens above a set limit is able to create a poll. Likewise, each voter who has more than the set minimum amount of Hermes (HMX) tokens, has the same voting power as anyone else.
- Ceres Tools - Ceres Tools is a platform which displays data from the Polkaswap DEX. Users are able to track tokens prices, liquidity pairs, pool details, as well as 24hr volume for each pair and for all available pairs. The platform is also available in the form of a mobile application for Android and iOS.
- Apollo Protocol - The Apollo Protocol is the lending and borrowing platform which enables its users to deposit and borrow assets. Depositors can provide liquidity and secure passive income through interest, while borrowers can leverage their assets without selling them and pay interest for this service.
- Ceres dApps - Ceres is an in-house project which is intended as a DeFi service provider in the Polkadot ecosystem. The Ceres dApps platform includes services such as Liquidity Locker and Token Locker.
- Ceres Launchpad - The Launchpad platform is the first station for new projects on the network. With Launchpad, new projects can easily launch their tokens on Polkaswap and users get more security because the Ceres Liquidity Locker and Ceres Token Locker are integrated.

Notably, Ceres has been predominantly active on Polkadot parachains, where they have successfully delivered most of their projects. This experience underlines their proficiency in navigating these platforms' unique ecosystems, contributing to their reputation as a versatile and capable blockchain developers. Their work, known for supporting multi-chain interoperability and innovation, aligns with Ceres' objectives of fostering a more accessible, efficient, and interconnected blockchain landscape.
